- Shapes **connections and opportunities** we see.

## Learning to think better
- More models -> bigger toolbox -> more likely to have right models to grasp reality.
- Decision making ability improves with variety of models.

- Engineer thinks in systems, pyschologist in incentives, biologist in evolution etc.
- Combining disciplines -> analyse problem in 3D way.
- Practical wisdom is not just isolated facts. They need to hang together on latticework of theory.
