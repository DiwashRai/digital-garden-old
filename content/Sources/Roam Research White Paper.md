We are experiencing an unprecedented explosion of knowledge, yet neither the human brain nor current technologies are equipped to ==harnesess== it to its ==full potential==.

## Brief
- Current approaches to knowledge management are ill suited for information age. They are usually 'cabinet like'.
	- Note: Presumable being hierarchical and isolated from one another.
- Cabinet approach makes it difficult to share ideas across your files and lack interconnectivity.
- Knowledge graphs are a more flexible data structure to tackle this challenge of knowledge management.
- Basic users: ease of storage, recollection of ideas and cross-referencing of ideas
- Power users: applications in logic and reasoning.
- ==Optimising for serendipity==. Humans have difficulty generating random numbers, thoughts etc. Exposure to random 'noise' can be the stimuli to new insights. These new insights usually occur at the juncture of two seemingly unrelated concepts.
- Roam's interconnectivity constantly creates opportunities for serendipity and new insights.
- _Collaborative problem solving - separating the noise from the signal:_ Current learning/research protocols are bound by necessary consensus. As information increases, so does noise, making it difficult to come to a consensus. A curated knowledge graph allows weighing up of conflicting opinions and ideas to develop your own understanding without autocracy (listening to one trusted source) or democracy (waiting for a full consensus that might never come).
