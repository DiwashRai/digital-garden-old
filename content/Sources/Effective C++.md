## Ch1: Accustoming yourself to C++  

### **Item 1:** View C++ as a federation of languages  
C++ is better understood as a group of related sub-languages. These are:
- C
- Object-oriented C++
- Template C++
- The STL

This is important to keep in mind as different sublanguages have different effective strategies and different conventions.


### **Item 2:** Prefer consts, enums, and inlines to \#defines  
Rule could also be called "Prefer the compiler over the preprocessor".   

```cpp
// BAD
#define ASPECT_RATIO 1.653

// GOOD
const double AspectRation = 1.653;
const char* const authorName = "Scott Meyers";
const std::string authorName("Scott Meyers");
```

The preprocessor will blindly subsitute ASPECT_RATIO for 1.653 resulting in multple copies in the object code.   

```cpp
// BAD
#define CALL_WITH_MAX(a,b) f((a) > (b) ? (a) : (b))

// GOOD
template<typename T>
inline void callWithMax(const T& a, const T& b)
{
    f(a > b ? a: b);
}
```
Function like macros can be very error prone. Calling `CALL_WITH_MAX(++a, b)` for example results in a being incremented twice.


### **Item 3:** Use const whenever possible  
- Helps detect usage errors.
- Using `const` in function declaration is extremely powerful so make use of it. It can refer to the function's return value, the individual parameters or even the function as a whole.
- Compilers enforce 'bitwise constness' but you should program using 'logical constness'.
	- Bitwise constness/Physical: does not modify any of object's data members
	- Logical constness: Some data members of an object can be modified but should be in ways the client cannot detect. Achieved using `mutable`. Also considers situations where something is bitwise const, but does not behave const. e.g. the altering of data members by returning non-const references.
- When const and non-const member functions have similar implementations, avoid duplication by calling const version in the non-const function and using `const_cast`.


### **Item 4:** Make sure objects are initialised before use
The rules about when objects initialisation is guaranteed or not is too complicated to be worth memorising. Avoid the issue by ==always initialising==. 
- For non-member built in types, this needs to be done manually. e.g. `int x = 0;`
- For the rest, initialisation is the responsibility of the constructors and the use of initialisation list is preferred.


## Ch2: Constructors, destructors and assignment operators  

### **Item 5:** Know what functions C++ silently writes and calls
Compilers will declare the following if you do not do so yourself:
- Copy constructor
- Copy assignment operator
- Destructor

If no constructors are declared at all, compilers will also declare:
- Default constructor

### **Item 6:** Explicitly disallow the use of compiler-generated functions you do not want
An example of an unwanted generated function is a copy constructor and copy assignment operator for objects that should not be copied.  

```cpp
HomeForSale h1;
HomeForSale h2;
HomeForSale h3(h1); //should not compile
h1 = h2;            // should not compile
```

To achieve this there is a ==well known trick==. Declare the functions private and do not implement them.

```cpp
class HomeForSale {
public:
    ...
private:
    HomeForSale(const HomeForSale&);
    HomeForSale& operator=(ocnst HomeForSale&);
}
```

This trick works and generates a link-time error. It is possible to move
it up to a compile time error by declaring the functions private in a base
class designed just to prevent copying.

>[!abstract] Summary
>- Disallow compiler generated function by declaring the function private and not providing an implementation

### **Item 7:** Declare destructors virtual in polymorphic base classes
Lets say you have a base class `TimeKeeper` and some derivided classes
that inherit from it:  
- AtomicClock
- WaterClock
- WristWatch

If you try to delete a derived class (e.g. WristWatch) with a base class
pointer (TimeKeeper), the results are undefined. Most likely, the derived
class parts of the object won't be deleted. This is a good way to leak
memory.

Solution is simple: ==give the base class a virtual destructor==.

However, when a class is not meant to be used as a base class, making it
virtual is usually a bad idea. This is because virtual functions require the
use of vptr ("virtual table pointers") which increases the size of the type.
A simple data type that contains two ints, would go from 64bits in size to
128bits. An increase of 100%. It also makes the object less portable to C.

> [!abstract] Summary
> - Polymorphic base classes should declare virtual destructors.
> - Any class with virtual functions should have a virtual destructor.
> - Classes that aren't base classes should not declare virtual destructors.
