## Problem Statement  
There is variabillity on human performance where somedays things
'click' and you perform very well and on other days you perform poorly.
This is somewhat counterintuitive as tecnically you have more
experience and knowledge every time you attempt something, however,
performance still seems to vary.

## The mind and the self
The self may say "I need to focus", however the mind "does not want
to focus". First we must acknowledge there are different parts of
'you'. The ability for the self to win involves the frontal lobe which
is responsible for things such as ==impulse control, delayed gratification and directing attention==.

The question is how do we skew the balance in the favour of the self.

In order of what the mind wants to do:  
1. High dopamine activity
2. 'Productive' task
3. The real work
4. Boredom

The 'mind' wants to get to the high dopamine activity. It will distract you
to force you into a state of boredom.
You can't tolerate boredom, so you'll tend towards something that is
productive but not the work you want to do.
Then at that point you will tell yourself its ok to indulge in the high
dopamine activity.

Crucially the mind knows you hate boredom and will weaponise it against you
to get to high dopamine activities. ALL of the minds power over you
revolves around boredom. However, ==you can tolerate boredom more than your mind can==.

Due to the fact that you can tolerate boredom more than your 'mind',
if you tell yourself that you only have two options: work or sleep;
your mind will eventually get productive due to the boredom.

## Sitting with the self
You have to notice the various tricks you or your mind play on yourself.
Sometimes it may say that you need to do additional prep before you can
do a specific task.This may be true sometimes, or sometimes it can be
the mind just give you excuses not to do the task. You need to just
accept that you will never truly be 'ready'.

You may also have the thought that since you can't focus today, you as
well enjoy the day. Yet again the conclusion is that you don't have to do
the work today.
