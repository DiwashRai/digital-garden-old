### 7 key points
- Vison journaling  (visualisation) - motivation
    - Inspired by Arnold Schwarzenegger - "When your vision is powerful enough, everything else falls into place"
    - **Write down what your ideal life would look like**
- 'Positive worry' - motivation
    - What if ...(series of good things)... happens to me?
    - **Write down a series of good things that could happen to you.**
- Focus on the one most important thing - productivity
    - Gary Keller - The One thing
    - Steve Jobs - "People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are."
    - Steps:
        - **Make a list of everything you COULD do**
        - **Narrow your focus. "What is the one thing I could do that would make everything else easier or even unnecessary?"**
- Think bigger. 10x exercise - productivity
- The brain dump - counter anxiety
    - **Write down all thoughts. No filters. Until everything you're worried about is written down.**
    - **Reassess**
- To counter procastrination - productivity
    - Usually because you need more clarity. Three most common reasons are:
        - Unclear effort
        - Unsure about capability/competence
        - Unclear on outcome
    - Steps:
        - **Ask why are you procrastinating**
        - **Write down resisting thoughts.**
        - **Dig deeper. Ask follow up questions**
- Gratitude on steroids - Mood elevation
