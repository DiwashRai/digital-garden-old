### Summary
Just like a chemical reaction, getting started on a task requires an initial
push or effort. Once you've started, it's often easier to keep going and
maintain momentum. But getting over that initial hump of *activation
energy* can be difficult.

### Insights and takeaway
- To counter this, target the energy required to **start** a task.
- Break down tasks into simpler and smaller steps.
