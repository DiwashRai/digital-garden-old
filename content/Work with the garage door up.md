"Work with the garage door up" is the idea that you should share what you're working on and learning to the public. The idea is that by sharing your work, you can document your progress and allow people to provide feedback, inspiration and support.  

Working with the garage door up can also have a motivating aspect to it. If you are publishing your development, you are more likely to keep consistent as well as to think through your ideas more. The transparency and openness also makes it naturally align with the philosophy of [anti-marketing](Anti-marketing.md).     

It seems to have similarities with the 'rubber duck debugging' method where even if no one is reading your notes/posts, the idea that it might be read by other people forces your mind to process the information more carefully which makes your own learning more effective.
