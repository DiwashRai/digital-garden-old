### Summary

Mental models are simplified representations of reality that are constructed
by individuals to help understand, reason, and take more effective action in
the world.

Mental models allow knowledge that we have gained to be organised into
smaller and more more understandable chunks. They increase the
efficiency in which you can access previously learn knowledge, especially
to retrieve just the useful conclusions.

### Why though?

> “Your entire life runs on the software – the models – in your head. Why wouldn't you obsess over optimizing it?” — _Tim Urban_

Here's an analogy that I use to think about the value of mental models:

Think of your IQ as the hardware of a computer - fixed and unchangeable.
But mental models are like software that run on the hardware. By upgrading
and refining your mental models, you can become a more effective thinker,
like upgrading software for better performance. The more mental models you
learn, the more sophisticated your thinking becomes. Just as software
needs to be optimized for specific tasks, mental models need to be chosen
and applied appropriately for best results.

### Examples

Some examples of mental models are:
- Pareto principle - suggests that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the
causes. Relevant for business, personal productivity,
time management etc.
- Occam's Razor - suggests that when there are multiple explanations for a
phenomenon, the simplest is *usually* the correct one.
- Second order thinking - encourages thinking beyond just the immediate
and direct consequences of a decision or action, and considering the second
order effects before making a decision.
