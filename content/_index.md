Welcome to my [digital garden](Digital%20Gardens.md) - I'm Diwash. I have been exploring personal knowledge management for a long time and this site is my experiment with doing so in a more public manner.  

You will mainly find notes about software engineering and productivity, however I am just getting started and plan on talking more about AI, PKM systems, mental models and many more.  

For now feel free to use the graph below to dive right in or the map of contents to choose a topic.
