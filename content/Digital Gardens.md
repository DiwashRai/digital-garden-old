### Intro
Digital gardens are an alternative model for thinking about personal sites and blogs that goes against how we have come to think about them. They also support the philosophy of [Work with the garage door up](Work%20with%20the%20garage%20door%20up.md) as you are publishing your notes and thoughts online for all to see.  

### Continuous growth
Digital gardens treat content not as something that is finalised and published, but something that is in an ever growing state. You are free to make additions to each page when you learn something new or make a new connection.  

### Network of concepts and ideas
The content in digital gardens are not laid out in some sort of time based 'stream' but as an [interconnected cluster of nodes](Networked%20Thinking.md). This allows for relationships between different topics/notes to be noticed and linked which can allow for better insights to be gained.  

### Exploration over performance
Digital gardens have a less performative philosophy. Each page is treated less like polished articles intended to be consumed by an audience, but more like a free form wiki of thought's an ideas that the person may note as they encounter them. You could argue that the primary audience for a digital garden is in fact the 'gardener' themselves. This idea frees the 'gardener' to not have to worry about making every sentence, every page perfect, but to focus on what they're interested in and what would benefit themselves (and perhaps other readers).  

### Playful and experimental
Digital gardens have a more playful and experimental nature to them. You will find a wide plethora of layouts, templates and languages used to create them. The aim is to find what works for you and to also have some fun so that you continue to maintain the garden. At the end of the day, the battle is to absorb the information that we are bombarded with daily in a way that can be applied in our own lives. For that to happen, we need to find what works for us and we have to stick with it.  

### Summary
- Digital gardens are continuously evolving and growing. No singular page or note should be considered truly complete as new connections and insights can always be made.
- Digital gardens are a network of nodes. This allows ideas/concepts to be linked easier and for the value of knowledge growth to be non-linear.
- Digital gardens value the creators own personal exploration and growth over presenting something as a finished product to an audience which brings with it a more performative mindset.
- Digital gardens are playful and experimental as they provide more value to us, the more fun we are having and the more personalised the garden is to our own needs.
