A new method of managing knowledge that is more suited to the modern information age where we have an unprecedented amount of information available. The idea is to think of each bit of knowledge as a singular node in an interconnected network of nodes instead of a more 'cabinet desk' like hierarchical strucuture for your knowledge.  

Benefits include:
- Ease of storage - No need to try to categorise a new bit of knowledge perfectly so that it sits in the correct location in your hierarchy.
- Better recollection - You can remember an idea itself, or any other node that it may be connected to or even a series of links to the idea you want to recall.
- Effortless cross-referencing - ideas can be cross-referenced easily without duplication.
- Optimised for serendipity - graphical display of node network can allow unexpected insights and connections to be made.
- 'Collaborative problem solving' - can help separate signal from the noise as you can consider conflicting opinions on the same topic and develop your own understanding or draw your own conclusions.
