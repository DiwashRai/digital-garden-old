Personal productivity created from a combination of insights from various sources with some real life testing to find something that works best for me.

### Method
- Brain dump
- Use brain dump to create check list
- Optional: Time block tasks from check list
- Review how well the framework worked for that specific project/task.

### Rationale
- Brain dump - Helps to get the ball rolling when I don't know where to start
- Creating a check list/plan before starting helps keep me focused in implementation phase. Having to pause to think what comes next or make a decision on what to tackle next can be just enough to get me distracted.
- Time blocking - prevents me from taking too long on individual tasks. This can happen when due to analysis paralysis or perfectionism.
