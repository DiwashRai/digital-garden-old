### Intelligence feedback vs Effort feedback
- Paper: Praise for intelligence can undermine children's motivation and performance -
Claudia M. Mueller & Carol S.Dweck  
- Kids that got intelligence feedback tended to pick 'doable' problems instead of challenging
problems the next time. Perhaps to ensure they continued to get positive feedback.  
- Kids that got effort based feedback tended to pick the challenging problems. This can lead to them
learning more.  
- Both are in a way seeking the positive feedback they got the first time.  
- When measuring raw performance after getting effort vs intelligence feedback:  
    - Control group performance stayed same  
    - Intelligence feedback went down significantly  
    - Effort feedback went up significantly  

### Growth mindset
- Tools:  
    - ==Shift internal narratives to more effort based narratives.== e.g.
        - I have a good memory (intelligence based) vs I have spent a lot of time with information
and developed my memory and information bank (effort based)
        - I am a bad musician (intelligence based) vs I have not spent much time learning an
instrument (effort based)
- Study about peoples response to error notes.
    - Fixed mindset: More of the brain's resources are focused on the emotional response. "Ugh. I
got it wrong. I thought it was right."
    - Growth mindset: More of the brain's resources focused on the appraisal. "Wait, what was the
right answer. How did I get it wrong?"
- ==Focus on the error and why you got it wrong==. Shift's the system towards growth mindset.

### Stress-is-enhancing mindset
- Utilising growth mindset requires us to think about errors, overcome errors and re-framing thought
patterns in our head.  
- Stress-is-enhancing mindset can allow us to access growth mindset much more easily.  
- Paper: Rethinking stress. How mindset affects our stress response
    - ==How we think about stress affects how we react to stress==
- Experiment:
    - Stress is diminishing message:
        - Soft tasks -> not much change in performance
        - Hard tasks -> no improvement
    - Stress is enhancing message:
        - Soft tasks -> 'some' improvements
        - Hard tasks -> significant improvement
- Stress-is-enhancing mindset can help you focus not on the physiological stress responses but to
focus on the task at hand more clearly.

### Tools
- Learning about growth mindset and how it differs from fixed mindset. Also learning about
stress-is-enhancing mindset.
- When giving praise, focus on verbs not labels. Try to focus on the effort, persistence etc.
- Seeking help to understand why they did not perform as well as you'd like.
- Write a letter to yourself explaining what growth mindset is and how it differs from fixed mindset
and also what stress-is-enhancing mindset is.
- Re-frame the "mind is like a muscle" analogy. The mind improves with the strain, agitation and
struggle of learning. With resistance training, you get to feel the improved performance during
training.
